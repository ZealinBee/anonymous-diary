# anonymous-diary
First fullstack project by myself, trying to understand backend better so I can understand what I should optimize on the frontend when working with others to make everyone's lives easier.
- The point of the website is for anyone to write their day on the website, anyone on the website will be able to see it, this is a good practice for basic POST and GET request, and also learning how to deploy the website, currently, the website is available at : https://anonymous-diary-fullstack.up.railway.app/
-Technologies used:
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React (Material UI and vanila CSS for the UI)
- Node.js
